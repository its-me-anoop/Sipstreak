WaterQuest Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 6, 2026

Summary
WaterQuest helps you track hydration and optionally use device data to personalize goals. We collect only what we need to provide the service. You can manage permissions in Settings at any time.

Information We Collect
- Account and subscription data provided by Apple (e.g., purchase status) via StoreKit.
- App usage data stored locally on your device (hydration entries, goals, preferences).
- Optional HealthKit data (workouts and water intake) if you grant permission.
- Optional location data if you grant permission (used for weather-based goal adjustments).
- Device notifications preference and schedule data to deliver reminders.

How We Use Information
- Provide hydration tracking, reminders, and progress insights.
- Calculate adaptive goals based on weather and activity (if enabled).
- Sync your data across devices if you use iCloud (where supported).
- Improve stability and performance of the app.

Health Data
- Health data is accessed only with your explicit permission and is used to adjust hydration goals and optionally sync water intake.
- Health data is never sold or used for advertising.

Location Data
- Location is used only to fetch local weather for adaptive hydration goals.
- We do not store precise location history.

Data Storage and Sync
- Your core hydration data is stored on your device.
- If iCloud sync is enabled, data may be stored in your private iCloud container.

Sharing
- We do not sell your data.
- We do not share your personal data with third parties except as needed to provide the app (e.g., Apple for purchases).

Security
We use platform security features (such as the iOS secure enclave and app sandboxing) to protect your data.

Your Choices
- You can disable HealthKit, Location, and Notifications at any time in Settings.
- You can delete the app to remove local data. If iCloud sync is enabled, you can manage iCloud data in iOS Settings.

Children
WaterQuest is not intended for children under 13.

Changes
We may update this policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the date above.
